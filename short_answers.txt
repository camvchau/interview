1. What does O(n) mean? O(n^2)?
   The Big-O notation is used to describe how an algorithm's performance scales in 
   the worst case as the input size increase. O(n) means that it will scale linearly, 
   proportional to the input size 'n'; O(n^2) means it will scale quadratically.

2. Describe the quick sort algorithm.
   From the list, choose an element and call it the pivot.  Compare all the elements 
   in the list to the pivot.  Move any element smaller than the pivot to before
   the pivot, and any larger element to behind the pivot. The pivot is then in its 
   correct position.  Repeat the same steps for the two sublists of elements 
   smaller and larger than the pivot.  In the base case, the size of the list will
   be zero or one element which does not need to be sorted.

3. In C, what is a pointer?
   A pointer is a variable that contains (if valid and not null) the memory location of
   an object.  Pointers may come with type information about the object that it points to.

4. What is the difference between Stack and Heap memory?
   Memory allocation is done by the operating system in the stack as opposed to manually, by using
   system calls, in the heap.  This leads to some behavior differences: the stack is limited in space
   while the heap is much larger; variables on the stack is local in scope and will deallocate when
   its thread exit while variables on the heap is global; variables is faster to allocate on the stack
   compared to the heap; and allocation size is known at compile time for the stack but can 
   be done dynamically for the heap.

5. What is the purpose of a garbage collector?
   The garbage collector manage memory deallocation for the user.  This allows for the use 
   of dynamically allocated memory without needing to manually free it later.
